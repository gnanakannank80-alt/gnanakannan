      Once upon a time, there lived a poor but hardworking woodcutter in a small
      village near a forest. Every day he went to the forest to cut wood and
      earned just enough money to buy food for his family. One afternoon, while
      cutting wood near a river, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into the
      deep water. The woodcutter became sad because the axe was his only tool to
      earn a living. He sat on the riverbank and cried. Suddenly, a fairy rose
      from the river and asked why he was crying. When the woodcutter explained,
      the fairy showed him a shining gold axe, but he said, “This is not mine.”
      Next, she showed him a silver axe, but he refused again. Finally, she
      brought his old iron axe, and he happily accepted it. The fairy smiled at
      his honesty and gifted him all three axes. The woodcutter returned home
      joyfully and continued working hard. He never sold the gold or silver
      axes; instead, he kept them safely to remind himself that honesty brings
      blessings. 📌 Moral: Honesty always brings rewards.

    In a large jungle, there lived a mighty lion who was feared by all animals.
    One day, after a big meal, the lion was resting peacefully under a huge
    tree. At that moment, a tiny mouse came running and accidentally climbed
    onto the lion’s paw. The lion woke up angrily and caught the mouse in his
    claws. The mouse trembled in fear and begged, “Please don’t hurt me! I’m
    small, but one day I might be able to help you.” Hearing this, the lion
    laughed loudlyoundations in life.Moral: Hard work and strong planning give
    strong results.All 10 stories have been added to your document in English,
